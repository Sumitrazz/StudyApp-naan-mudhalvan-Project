## 2. Project Overview


**Purpose**:  
StudyApp is a comprehensive educational platform developed as part of the Naan Mudhalvan project. The application provides a seamless learning experience, enabling users to access educational resources, track progress, and engage in interactive learning modules.


**Features**:
- User authentication and profile management
- Access to a wide range of study materials and resources
- Progress tracking and performance analytics
- Interactive quizzes and assessments
- Real-time notifications and updates
- Community features for collaborative learning

## 3. Architecture


- **Frontend**:  
  The frontend is built using **React.js** along with **Redux Toolkit** for state management and **TailwindCSS** for styling. Components are organized for modularity and reusability.


- **Backend**:  
  The backend is structured using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. It handles API endpoints, authentication, and CRUD operations, with middleware for validation and authorization.


- **Database**:  
  **MongoDB** is used to store and manage user data, study materials, and community interactions. Collections include `Users`, `StudyMaterials`, and `StudyGroups`.

## 8. Authentication


Authentication is implemented using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**. Upon login, users receive a token, which is stored locally on the client and used for secure access to protected routes. The backend includes middleware to validate tokens.

- **Dashboard View**: ![Dashboard](./screenshots/dashboard.png)
- **Study Materials**: ![Study Materials](./screenshots/study_materials.png)

## 10. Testing


Testing is conducted with **Jest** and **React Testing Library** on the frontend, and **Mocha** on the backend. Tests cover both unit and integration aspects to ensure application stability.
